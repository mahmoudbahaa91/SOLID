# S.O.L.I.D Principles

* **Single responsibility principle:** <br />
   A class should have only one reason to change.

* **Open/Closed principle - Software:** <br />
  entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

* **Liskov Substitution Principle:** <br />
  Child classes should never break the parent class type definitions, or child classes should act same as parent class.

* **Interface Segregation Principle:** <br />
  No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use, or a big interface with unrelated method should be divided into small interfaces with related method.

* **Dependency inversion principle:** <br />
  High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
